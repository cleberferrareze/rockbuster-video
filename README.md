# Rockbuster Video

## Motivation
* Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services companies, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

* With the aim to provide insights for the management team, 1000 rented films from 599 individual customers were analysed and a [data dictionary](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YnGrQ9WwNx5OK3NAGGZajLyXvqt2sMDc/view?usp=sharing) was produced. 

* The dataset was uploaded into a relational database management system (RDBMS), the PostgreSQL, where [queries](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FeaNMiSDVlpeQEaWNcWQxScNksJbRdbq/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113829169484980023518&rtpof=true&sd=true) were developed to analyze the data and answer the key business questions raised by the team. 

* Insights were presented in Tableau's Storyboard where you can see below and via [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cleber.juliano.f/viz/Rockbuster_16257667057540/Story1).
